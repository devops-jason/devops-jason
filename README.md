I am a DevOps engineer and I created this github account for projects in my spare time. Right now, I am busy working on projects for my job, but I am planning to start adding stuff to github soon.

## Company Gem

Plan on writting a ruby gem called company to model a company and some various aspects of it. Still in the planning phase but it will be a simple gem just meant to make it easier to model your company or a company in your ruby code.
