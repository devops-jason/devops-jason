I am a DevOps Engineer. My Github account is for projects I want to work on in my spare time. 

Ruby and Python tend to be the languages I write in. Feel free to use any of my projects if they help. 

## Projects

Plan doing a few things as of right now.  First, I will be writing a gem and an egg for an idea I had.  Second, using omnibus and some of the gitlab source for omnibus create a self-contained project to use on my Mac and on my AWS Linux instances.

To be continued.....
